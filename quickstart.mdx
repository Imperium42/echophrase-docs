# Quick Start

Get Echophrase running on your machine in just a few steps.

## 1. Download & Install

Download the latest version for your platform from the [downloads page](/download).

## 2. Launch Echophrase

Open Echophrase from your applications menu. On first launch, it will download the AI model (~150MB).

2. Hold **Ctrl+Shift+Space** (or your configured hotkey)
3. Speak naturally
4. Release the keys — your words appear as text

That's it! You're ready to go.
