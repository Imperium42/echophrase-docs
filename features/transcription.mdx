# Transcription

Echophrase uses OpenAI's Whisper model to convert your speech to text with high accuracy.

## How It Works

Echophrase captures audio from your microphone, processes it locally using the Whisper AI model, and types the transcribed text wherever your cursor is positioned.

## Supported Languages

Whisper supports 99+ languages including:

- English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
- Chinese, Japanese, Korean
- Arabic, Hindi, Russian
- And many more...

## Accuracy

Transcription accuracy depends on:

- **Model size**: Larger models are more accurate but slower
- **Audio quality**: Clear audio produces better results
- **Background noise**: Quiet environments work best

See [Model Selection](/config/models) to choose the right balance for your needs.
